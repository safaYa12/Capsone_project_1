# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Capstone Project

This repository contains my practical cybersecurity capstone project, demonstrating real-world skills across vulnerability scanning, malware analysis, password auditing, and incident response scenarios.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project is designed to simulate real-world offensive and defensive security tasks. It combines vulnerability assessment, process and memory injection research, malware static and dynamic analysis, password auditing, and customer threat notifications.

---

## ‚úÖ Exercises Covered

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Vulnerability Scanning & Reporting
- Installed and configured **OpenVAS / Nessus Essentials** on a Linux machine.
- Performed a full vulnerability scan targeting localhost.
- Documented discovered vulnerabilities and severity levels.
- Researched and recommended remediation steps.
- Collected screenshots of scan results.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Malware Injection & Memory Research
- Explained **process injection** and common malware variants.
- Described at least **four memory injection techniques** in detail.
- Provided clear examples of how attackers use these methods.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sysinternals Tools & Malware Static Analysis
- Used **TCPView** to monitor and document live network connections.
- Audited weak passwords using **L0phtCrack**.
- Created a controlled educational malware specimen with **JPS VirusMaker** (safe VM only).
- Analyzed the malware‚Äôs PE header with **PEiD** to identify sections, entropy, and imports.
- Applied **Process Explorer**, **Process Monitor**, and **Autoruns** for dynamic binary analysis.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Incident Response & Scenarios
- Drafted a professional notification for an Emotet infection incident.
- Described workflow for handling targeted phishing campaigns.
- Outlined red team testing steps to identify vulnerabilities before a new product release.
- Documented key recommendations to prevent zero-day attacks.
